\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented a approach of use Hybrid Metaheuristc in load, performance and stress testing. Two experiments were performed to validate the solution. The first experiment has been applied in an emulated component and the second experiment has been applied in an installed Moodle application.  The collaborative approach has obtained better fit values in both experiments. 

The main contributions of the research are: The presentation of an approach that uses a hybrid metauristc to perform load, performance and stress tests;  The development of a JMeter plugin  to evolutionary tests and  the automation of the  load, performance or stress test execution process.

Among the future work of the research, we can highlight the use of new combinatorial optimization algorithms such as Very large-scale neighborhood search.
